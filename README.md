# Hotel booking demo application

![Preview image of the client](./client/public/static/hotelapp_preview.webp)

Hotel booking application demo project, books hotel rooms to the clients of the hotels. Meant to act as a simple microservices deployment project. 

Configuration server segregates and centralizes the application configuration data from the services and maintains the application properties for them, acting as a centralized configuration. Configuration server uses HashiCorp Vault configuration repository to store the application properties that are sensitive. HashiCorp Vault is itself the backend for the configuration server to securely access the properties. Service Registry is implemented by Spring Cloud Eureka built in the discovery directory. Services register themselves to the registry, other services can obtain the location of a service instance by querying the service registry, which knows the locations of all service instances. This is further utilized by the Gateway, which does the esrvice routing, to provide a single entry point for all the services. It implements API Gateway pattern, all teh traffic routes through API Gateway and the gateway will route the requests to the appropriate services. Redhat Keycloak acts as an STS/Authorization server for the gateway and the client, handling user authenticatino and authorization. Persistence is handled through Apache Cassandra, which deploys two nodes by default. Comes with built-in cluster, eventual consistency and linear write scalability, making it decent fit for the service oriented structure of project, although the deployment model itself is contrived for the sake of learning.

The services themselves are implemented in the customer-service and hotel-service directories, both which interface with Apache Cassandra instances. Hotel-service is the handles giving out the hotels, cities, bookings and rooms for the client and customer-service handles user data like keeping user data and invoices. Redis acts as a distributed cache for the services and Apache Kafka is used to implements logging through out services.

# How do I run this application?

1. `$ make initialize`, initializes necessary volumes, networks and secrets.
2. `$ make casmaster caspair hcpvault keycloak kafka redis`, deploys cassandra instances, HCP Vault, Redhat Keycloak, Apache Kafka and Redis (all the "external" applications).
3. `$ make cfg discovery`, builds and deploys the configuration server and discovery.
4. `$ make services`, builds and deploys all the services being used by the client.
5. `$ make gateway`, builds and deploys the Gateway, reserved as the second last operation so it access all the services immediately.
6. `$ make client`, builds and deploys the client, reserved as the last operation so it access the gateway, although this is not strictly necessary until request to services are made.

**NOTE: Current setup uses environment variables, make sure you have defined these beforehand!**

I am using .envs file where I set SWARMHOST, DOCKER\_CTX\_<number> for the deployment, only thing I need to do is to source the file:  
```bash
$ source .envs
```
    
These environment variables are mainly used for cassandra, importing docker images onto other hosts and in the client deployment.

**NOTE on building config-server, gateway and discovery: Current setup has config-server, discovery and gateway using image-importer.sh script to update images on the other host. To put this off the current build cycle, you only need to take off the $(MAKE) import invocation on the recipes in question.**

Deployment has only been tested on x86_64 GNU/Linux, 5.10.0-13-amd64 and subsequent remote machines are assumed to have x86_64 GNU/Linux with **required software**.

# Multihost or single host deployment?

If you're using a multihost deployment, you can define environment variables, and these will be subsequently be used in the Makefile up to two, because thats how many I used myself excluding the local host.

For example: `$ export MULTIHOST_ONE=myuser@192.168.239.133`.

* `MULTIHOST_<number>` environment variables are used in some of the Makefiles and scripts to perform deployment onto other remote hosts.

* `DOCKERHOST_<number>` environment variables define remote docker contexts used in cassandra deployment.

It is also possible to run this application on a singlehost, if you have computer that has required memory and processing power. Currently however this deployment is tuned for multihost setup.
*NOTE: I have not tried single host deployment with all the applications running, only multihost, so I cannot say how runnable it actually is, but with little tweaks it should not be hard to come by.*

# Client

The client for the application is a runnign on TypeScript 4.5.4, React 17.0.2 and the application running on Webpack 5 for module bundling and Babel 7 for polyfilling. The deployment happens through NodeJS express server, using webpack-dev-middleware. To change the deployment variables, you can use an .env file.

To run the client: `$ make build deploy`

Running the client by itself: `$ npm i && npm run serve`

# Running HashiCorp Vault

Vault can be deployed and initialized with: ```$ make hcpvault```.  
Vault can also be optionally deployed using docker-compose with ```$ sh vault/startup.sh -c -i --root ${PWD}```.  

The sensitive data is in the `vault/vault/data` directory, where you can store data to. `vault/vault` directory also contains configuration for the vault and policies. Because this is ridicously sluggish deployment already, I keep .envs file in this directory to define the environmental variables used in the make recipes, so I can set them fast. The .envs file is just a simple bash script that sets the environmental variables.

NOTE: ```$ make hcpvault``` uses predefined arguments to run the vault/startup.sh script, you can change these arguments in the Makefile yourself if you wish or just run the script yourself with arguments ```$ sh vault/startup.sh --help``` for more.

# Running Redhat Keycloak

Keycloak can be deployed and initialized with: `$ make keycloak`. 
This deployes and initializes vault with predefined arguments in the make recipe.

You can change these arguments to your liking by changing the Makefile or just using the script yourself: ```$ sh keycloak/startup.sh --help```.

# Running Apache Cassandra

You can deploy cassandra instance using `$ make casmaster`.
This deploys and initializes Apache Cassandra instance with predefined scheme and data for the hotelapp application. Note that the cassandra/startup.sh is merely for initialization and the actual deployment is done by a make recipe -> `make master` or `make pair`

You can change these arguments to your liking by changing the Makefile or just using the script yourself:   
```$ sh casssandra/startup.sh --help```.

# Structure of the application

Gateway guards the microservices and uses Keycloak as the STS into the application.

If you try to deploy this app with: `$ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml multi-tier-app`, you will most likely be greeted by "secret not found error". Swarm requires that all cluster-level resources that a service depends on exist prior to proceeding with the deployment. So Docker halted the application deployment when it determined a resource dependency was missing.

The missing cluster-level resource that this application depends on is the POSTGRES\_PASSWORD secret. Recall that the applicationâ€™s reference to that secret said that it was defined externally, if you look at the compose file `secrets` property. In this context, external means defined outside the application deployment definition and provided by Swarm.

To view secrets you can use `$ docker secret ls`

**Note! Directory names are used by the deployment and build scripts to a significant enough extent, so that changing names of them may break functionality of some of the scripts.**
