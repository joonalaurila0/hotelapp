# How do I run this application?

1. `$ make initialize`, initializes necessary volumes, networks and secrets.
2. `$ make casmaster caspair hcpvault keycloak`, deploys cassandra instances, HCP Vault and Redhat Keycloak (all the "external" applications).
3. `$ make cfg discovery`, builds and deploys the configuration server and discovery.
4. `$ make services`, builds and deploys all the services being used by the client.
5. `$ make gateway`, builds and deploys the Gateway, reserved as the second last operation so it access all the services immediately.
6. `$ make client`, builds and deploys the client, reserved as the last operation so it access the gateway, although this is not strictly necessary until request to services are made.

# HashiCorp Vault

Vault can be deployed and initialized with data from commandline arguments and vault/vault directory by running: `$ make hcpvault`.

Vault can also be optionally deployed using docker-compose with `$ sh vault/startup.sh -c -i --root ${PWD}`

NOTE: `$ make hcpvault` uses predefined arguments to run the vault/startup.sh script, you can change these arguments in the Makefile yourself if you wish or just run the script yourself with arguments `$ sh vault/startup.sh --help` for more.

# Redhat Keycloak

Keycloak can be deployed and initialized with: `$ make keycloak`. 
This deployes and initializes vault with predefined arguments in the make recipe.

You can change these arguments to your liking by changing the Makefile or just using the script yourself: `$ sh keycloak/startup.sh --help`.

# Apache Cassandra

You can deploy cassandra instance using `$ make casmaster`.
This deploys and initializes Apache Cassandra instance with predefined scheme and data for the hotelapp application. Note that the cassandra/startup.sh is merely for initialization and the actual deployment is done by a make recipe -> `make master` or `make pair`

You can change these arguments to your liking by changing the Makefile or just using the script yourself: `$ sh casssandra/startup.sh --help`.

# Structure of the application

Gateway guards the microservices and uses Keycloak as the STS into the application.

If you try to deploy this app with: `$ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml multi-tier-app`, you will most likely be greeted by "secret not found error". Swarm requires that all cluster-level resources that a service depends on exist prior to proceeding with the deployment. So Docker halted the application deployment when it determined a resource dependency was missing.

The missing cluster-level resource that this application depends on is the POSTGRES\_PASSWORD secret. Recall that the applicationâ€™s reference to that secret said that it was defined externally, if you look at the compose file `secrets` property. In this context, external means defined outside the application deployment definition and provided by Swarm.

To view secrets you can use `$ docker secret ls`

**Note! Directory names are used by the deployment and build scripts to a significant enough extent, so that changing names of them may break functionality of some of the scripts.**
